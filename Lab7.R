# 1. Assume that the mean amount of sleep an adult gets is 7.8 hours 
#    per night. Is there evidence that students in CSC 315 
#    get a different amount of sleep? (Here we assume that our 
#    survey results are representative of all CSC 315 students).

# (a) State the null and alternative hypotheses (done for you):

# H0: mu_sleep = 7.9
# HA: mu_sleep != 7.9

# where mu_sleep is the mean amount of sleep a CSC 315 student gets
# per night.

# (b) Calculate / find the test statistic (and specify the degrees of freedom)

res <- t.test(survey$Sleep, mu = 7.9)
t <- res$statistic
t

# (c) Find the p-value using the t.test function

res$p.value

# The p-value is 0.0007533573

# (d) Find the p-value 'manually' based on the test statistic and
#     appropriate degrees of freedom 

2*pt(-abs(t), df = res$parameter) # p-value

# The p-value is 0.0007533573, similar to 1c.

# (e) State the conclusion regarding the null and alternative hypotheses in 
#     the context of this problem.

# Since the p-value of 0.0007533573 falls below 0.05, we reject the null 
# hypothesis in favor of the alternative. This means there is sufficient 
# evidence that students in CSC 315 get a different amount of sleep than 
# average adult.

# 2. Is there evidence that the college GPA of a 'cat' person 
# differs from that of a 'dog' person?

# (a) State the null and alternative hypotheses (done for you):

#   H0: mu_cat - mu_dog = 0
#   HA: mu_cat - mu_dog != 0,

#   where mu_cat and mu_dog are the mean college GPAs for students preferring
#   cats and dogs, respectively

# (b) Create side-by-side boxplots (using ggplot) showing College GPA for 'cat' and
#     'dog' people. Make sure to label the y-axis and give the 
#     chart a title.

  geom_boxplot() + theme(legend.position = "none") +

  labs(x = "Cat or Dog", y = "College GPA")

# (c) We will now formally test the hypotheses that mean college GPA
#     is different between 'cat' and 'dog' people. The command 
#     t.test(x,y) will perform a two-sample t-test for the null 
#     hypothesis that the 'x' and 'y' populations have the same mean.
#     Use the t.test function to find the test statistic and the 
#     corresponding degrees of freedom. Note that in your call to t.test,
#     'x' is a vector of College GPAs for 'cat' people and 'y' is a 
#     vector of College GPAs for 'dog' people

s <- split(survey$collegeGPA, survey$CatOrDogPerson)

res <- t.test(s$Cat, s$Dog)
res 

# Cat people have an average college GPA of 3.615, and dog people
# have an average college GPA of 3.402727.

# (d) Find the p-value from the result of the t.test function

res$p.value

# The p-value is 0.1912803. 

# (e) Find the p-value 'manually' based on the test statistic and
#     appropriate degrees of freedom from the t.test result (which 
#     is stored in the $parameter object)

2*pt(-abs(res$statistic), df = res$parameter)

# (f) State the conclusion regarding the null and alternative hypotheses in 
#     the context of this problem.

# Since the p-value of 0.1912803 is above 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. 
# There is not sufficient enough evidence that the college GPA of a 'cat' person 
# differs from that of a 'dog' person. 

# (g) What would it mean in the context of this problem if a Type I 
#     error occurred?

# A type one error would mean we conclude that there is not sufficient enough
# evidence that the college GPA of a 'cat' person differs from that of a 'dog' person,
# when in reality the college GPA of a 'cat' person differs from that of a 'dog' person.

# 3:  Find the p-values associated with the following t test

# (a) t = 2.78, n = 45

2*pt(-abs(2.78), df = 45 - 1)

# Since the p-value of 0.0079072 falls below 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis, in favor
# of the alternative.

# (b) t = -3.3, n = 51

2*pt(-abs(-3.3), df = 51 - 1)

# Since the p-value of 0.00176857 falls below 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis, in favor
# of the alternative.

# (c) t = 1.11, n = 100

2*pt(-abs(1.11), df = 100 - 1)

# 4:  The 'sugars' column contains the sugar content (in grams), while

# (b) Use the t.test function to find the test statistic 
#     and corresponding degrees of freedom

s <- split(cereal$sugars, cereal$shelf)

res <- t.test(s$lower, s$middle)
res$statistic
res$parameter

# (c) Find the p-value

res$p.value

# (d) State the conclusion regarding the null and alternative hypotheses in 
#     the context of this problem.

# Since the p-value of 0.002149394 falls below 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. 
# This means there is suffcient evidence that the mean sugar conents in the cereals 
# on the middle shelf differ from the cereals on the the lower shelf.
