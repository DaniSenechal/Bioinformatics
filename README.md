# Bioinformatics Programming and Analysis (ECSU)
These are several projects from Bioinformatics at ECSU. They were all coded in R, and along with the R Scripts, I uploaded the knitted documents that contain 
the input as well as output since some of the data sets used are too large to upload on Git.

## Technologies
Projects were created with:
* RStudio: R version 3.6.1 (2019-07-05).

## Installation
Install [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) to run the code.
Download the following packages by typing these commands in the terminal. These packages are loaded in the available code.  
```bash
install.packages("readr")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("gtools")
install.packages("cowplot")
install.packages("affy")
install.packages("limma")
install.packages("GEOquery")
```
  
 Download the data and read it in R by using the command:
```bash
name <- read.csv("your directory")
```
where "your directory" is the pathname of the data file, and name can be changed to a variable name that more accurately represents the data set.



## Status
These projects are all completed. 

## Inspiration
This project was completed for CSC 315: Bioinformatics Programming and Analysis at ECSU in the Fall of 2019.
